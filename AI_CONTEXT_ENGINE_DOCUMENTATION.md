## Dynamic Context Components

The dynamic context changes for each message and consists of 5 key components:

### 1. Recent Chat History

**Purpose**: Provides conversational flow and immediate context  
**Format**: Chronological list of previous messages

```
## Recent Conversation History:
Message 1: user - Hello we're using Gemini 1.5 Flash model and getting error in response
Message 2: ai_pm - I understand you're encountering a problem while using the Gemini 1.5 Flash model...
Message 3: user - which AI model generating response with high confidence? in above terminal logs?
```

**Details**:
- Last 10 messages from current session
- Includes: role, content, timestamp
- Updated with each new message
- Essential for maintaining conversation coherence

### 2. Relevant Memories

**Purpose**: Provides historical context and past solutions  
**Source**: Redis storage with semantic relevance scoring

```json
Relevant Memories: [
  {
    "type": "context",
    "key": "context_context_1757302993.596667",
    "value": {
      "user_input": "INFO:app.services.redis_service:Redis connection established",
      "ai_response": {"confidence": 0.9, "model": "gemini-1.5-flash"}
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-09-08T10:18:45.250246",
    "relevance_score": 0.85
  },
  {
    "type": "error",
    "key": "error_log_1", 
    "value": {
      "error_message": "Warning: require(C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\...)",
      "solution": "Check file paths and dependencies"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-09-08T20:17:44.721789",
    "relevance_score": 0.72
  }
]
```

**Memory Types Searched**:
- **ERROR**: Past errors and their solutions
- **SOLUTION**: Successful implementation approaches
- **CONTEXT**: Project-specific information
- **DEPENDENCY**: Technical dependencies and requirements
- **MESSAGE**: Previous chat interactions

### 3. Context Analysis

**Purpose**: Provides quantitative assessment of available information  
**Calculation**: Real-time scoring based on retrieved memories

```
Context Analysis:
- Context Score: 1.0          # How relevant memories are to current query
- Completeness Score: 0.25    # How diverse the information types are
- Confidence Score: 0.7      # Overall confidence for response generation
- Suggested Actions: [
  "Proceed with verification steps",
  "Review 10 relevant memories from past interactions"
]
```

### 4. Current User Request

**Purpose**: The specific message being processed  
**Format**: Exact user input with processing instructions

```
## Current User Request:
what exact session id it has in logs tell me

IMPORTANT: Use the conversation history above to understand the context of the current request. Reference previous messages when relevant.

Please provide your response in the specified JSON format.
```

## Adaptive Workflow Management

### Overview

The Adaptive Workflow Management system adds progressive analysis depth tracking to ensure systematic problem-solving and prevent the loss of original problem context during multi-cycle analysis workflows.

### Workflow Context Injection

**Purpose**: Provides workflow state and progression guidance to the AI  
**Source**: Redis-based workflow state management  
**Location**: Injected into dynamic context as `workflow` object

```json
"workflow": {
  "current_depth": 2,
  "original_problem": "I have authentication issues in my Next.js app",
  "completed_stages": 2,
  "analysis_complete": false,
  "recent_insights": [
    "Initial problem analysis completed",
    "Security vulnerabilities identified"
  ]
}
```

### Workflow Progression Logic

The system implements intelligent workflow advancement based on:

1. **Confidence Threshold**: Advance when confidence ≥ 0.95
2. **Completion Signals**: Advance when AI includes "ANALYSIS_COMPLETE" or "READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION"
3. **Progressive Deepening**: Each level must uncover new insights, not repeat previous analysis

### Depth Level Structure

```
Level 0: Problem identification and scope definition
Level 1: Surface-level analysis of affected components  
Level 2: Deep system architecture analysis
Level 3: Root cause and dependency analysis
Level 4: Solution architecture and implementation planning
Complete: Ready for implementation
```

### State Persistence

**Storage**: Redis with project-specific keys  
**Key Pattern**: `project:{project_id}:memory:workflow:state`  
**TTL**: 30 days (same as other memories)  
**Compression**: Previous stage outputs compressed to ~200 tokens  

### Context Efficiency

**Memory Usage**: < 5% of available context tokens  
**Overhead**: ~1KB per message for workflow state  
**Compression**: Maintains only last 3 stage summaries  

### Integration with Existing System

The workflow system integrates seamlessly with the existing context engine:

1. **Initialization**: Workflow manager created per request in `ChatProcessor.process_chat_message()`
2. **Context Injection**: Added to AI context in `_prepare_ai_context()` method
3. **Advancement Logic**: Triggered after AI response generation
4. **Storage**: Uses existing Redis memory system with `MessageType.CONTEXT`

### User Experience

**Progressive Deepening**: Each response shows current analysis depth and new insights discovered  
**Clear Progression**: Users see "Depth 0 → Depth 1 → Depth 2 → Complete" progression  
**No Context Loss**: Original problem preserved throughout entire workflow  
**Completion Signals**: Clear indication when ready for implementation  

### Example Workflow Flow

```
User: "I have auth issues in my Next.js app"
AI: [Depth 0] Initial problem analysis (Confidence: 0.75)

User: "Analyze this deeper"  
AI: [Depth 1] Component-level analysis (Confidence: 0.82)

User: "What about security?"
AI: [Depth 2] Security vulnerability analysis (Confidence: 0.91)

User: "Ready for implementation?"
AI: [Depth 3] ANALYSIS_COMPLETE - Ready for implementation (Confidence: 0.96)
```

## Memory Retrieval Process

The context engine uses a sophisticated 4-step process to retrieve relevant memories:

### Step 1: Key Term Extraction

**Input**: User message text  
**Process**: Natural language processing to extract meaningful terms

```
Input: "what exact session id it has in logs tell me"
Process: 
- Convert to lowercase
- Remove punctuation and special characters
- Filter out stop words (65 common words)
- Remove words shorter than 3 characters
Output: ["exact", "session", "id", "logs", "tell"]
```

### Step 2: Memory Search

**Scope**: All memories for the current project  
**Types**: ERROR, SOLUTION, CONTEXT, DEPENDENCY, MESSAGE  
**Limit**: 100 memories maximum

```
Search Pattern: "project:{project_id}:memory:*"
Memory Types: [ERROR, SOLUTION, CONTEXT, DEPENDENCY, MESSAGE]
Retrieval Limit: 100 memories
```

### Step 3: Relevance Scoring

**Formula**: Complex scoring algorithm considering multiple factors

```
For each memory:
1. Term Frequency: Count how many key terms appear in memory content
2. Term Weighting: Multiply by term length (longer terms = more weight)
3. Time Decay: Apply exponential decay based on memory age
   decay_factor = e^(-0.1 × age_in_hours)
4. Final Score: (term_frequency × term_length) × time_decay

Threshold: Only memories with score >= 0.3 are included
```

### Step 4: Top Memory Selection

**Process**: Sort and filter memories for final context

```
1. Sort all scored memories by relevance score (descending)
2. Apply time decay to adjust scores based on age
3. Filter memories below relevance threshold (0.3)
4. Select top 10 memories for AI context
5. Add relevance_score metadata to each selected memory
```

## Context Scoring System

Three key scores are calculated to assess context quality:

### Context Score (0-1)

**Purpose**: Measures relevance of retrieved memories to current query  
**Formula**: `total_relevance_scores / number_of_key_terms`

```
Example:
- Key terms: ["exact", "session", "id", "logs"] (4 terms)
- Total relevance: 4.0 (sum of all memory relevance scores)
- Context Score: 4.0 / 4 = 1.0
```

**Interpretation**:
- **High (>0.7)**: Very relevant memories found
- **Medium (0.3-0.7)**: Moderately relevant memories
- **Low (<0.3)**: Few relevant memories found

### Completeness Score (0-1)

**Purpose**: Measures diversity of information types available  
**Formula**: `(has_errors + has_solutions + has_context + has_dependencies) / 4`

```
Checks for:
- Has error information? (1/0)
- Has solution examples? (1/0) 
- Has project context? (1/0)
- Has dependency information? (1/0)

Example:
- Has errors: ✓ (1)
- Has solutions: ✓ (1)
- Has context: ✗ (0)
- Has dependencies: ✗ (0)
- Completeness Score: (1+1+0+0)/4 = 0.5
```

### Confidence Score (0-1)

**Purpose**: Overall confidence for AI response generation  
**Formula**: `(context_score × 0.6) + (completeness_score × 0.4)`

```
Example:
- Context Score: 0.8
- Completeness Score: 0.5
- Confidence Score: (0.8 × 0.6) + (0.5 × 0.4) = 0.48 + 0.20 = 0.68
```

**Interpretation**:
- **High (>0.8)**: AI can respond with high confidence
- **Medium (0.5-0.8)**: AI can respond but some verification needed
- **Low (<0.5)**: AI should request more information

## Action Recommendation Logic

Based on the calculated scores, the AI receives specific action recommendations:

### Low Context (< 0.3)

**Recommendations**:
- "Request more specific details about the issue"
- "Gather more error information, solution examples, project context, dependency information"

**AI Behavior**: Should ask clarifying questions rather than providing solutions

### Medium Context (0.3-0.7)

**Recommendations**:
- "Proceed with verification steps"
- "Review X relevant memories from past interactions"

**AI Behavior**: Can provide solutions but should include verification steps

### High Context (> 0.7)

**Recommendations**:
- "High confidence - proceed with implementation"
- "Use past solutions directly with minimal verification"

**AI Behavior**: Can provide confident solutions with minimal verification
