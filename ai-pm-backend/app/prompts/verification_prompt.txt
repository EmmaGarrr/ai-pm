Generate a verification prompt to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the proposed solution before proceeding. The verification should:

1. **Specificity Check**: Demand line-by-line verification for complex operations
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Verify all dependencies are available and compatible
3. **Impact Assessment**: Analyze potential impacts on existing systems
4. **Regression Prevention**: Identify potential issues that could break existing functionality
5. **Confidence Validation**: Ensure confidence assessment is realistic

## Verification Questions:
- **Context Completeness**: Do we have all necessary information to proceed?
- **Dependencies**: Are all required dependencies available and properly configured?
- **Impact Analysis**: What existing functionality might be affected by these changes?
- **Testing Strategy**: How will we verify the implementation works correctly?
- **Fallback Plan**: What if the implementation doesn't work as expected?

## Structure:
```
## Verification Required Before Implementation

### Context Analysis
- [ ] Verify all user requirements are understood
- [ ] Check for missing information or ambiguities
- [ ] Confirm project context and constraints

### Dependency Verification
- [ ] List all required packages and versions
- [ ] Check compatibility with existing system
- [ ] Verify installation and configuration

### Impact Assessment
- [ ] Identify files that will be modified
- [ ] Analyze potential breaking changes
- [ ] Consider performance implications

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Define test cases for verification
- [ ] Plan integration testing approach
- [ ] Set up rollback procedures

### Confidence Assessment
- Current confidence: [X]%
- Confidence justification: [explanation]
- Additional information needed: [list]
```

## Confidence-Based Verification Intensity:
- **High Confidence (>85%)**: Basic verification, focus on critical paths
- **Medium Confidence (70-85%)**: Moderate verification, check edge cases
- **Low Confidence (<70%)**: Comprehensive verification, demand more analysis

Remember to adjust verification intensity based on the confidence assessment and complexity of the proposed solution. Higher risk or lower confidence solutions require more thorough verification.
